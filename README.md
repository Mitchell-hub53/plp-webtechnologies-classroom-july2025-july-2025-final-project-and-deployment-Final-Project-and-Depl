# 🌱 AgriGrow - Online Seedling Delivery Website

Hi there 👋, welcome to my project!  
This is **AgriGrow**, a static, responsive, and interactive website I built for my **PLP Web Development Course Final Assignment**.  

The idea behind AgriGrow is simple: farmers should have an easy way to access quality seedlings, and this site demonstrates how such a business could operate online.

## 📌 What the Website Does
- Provides a **multi-page structure** with clear navigation (Home, About, Services, Contact).
- Shows information about AgriGrow and the seedlings we deliver.
- Has a **hero banner** with an agricultural backdrop.
- Features **service cards** for Tomato, Cabbage, and Maize seedlings.
- Includes a **contact form** so users can reach out.
- Uses **JavaScript** for smooth scrolling and active link highlighting.
- Is **mobile-responsive** and looks clean on all devices.
